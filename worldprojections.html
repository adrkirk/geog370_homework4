    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">To display maps in different projections, I first added a world map layer using the shapefile found in the "Worldprojections" Zip file.
    Next, I added Tissot's circles to the world map using the "Indicatrix Mapper" plugin in order to illustrate how various projections distort the area, shape, distance, and direction of geographic regions.
    Finally, I changed the map's coordinate reference system or projection through the EPSG button at the bottom righthand corner of the screen.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Although distance, area and shape are slightly distorted, direction is preserved. This projection appears to achieve a favorable balance between distortion and preservation of these variables for navigation purposes.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection, shape, area, distance, and direction are all somewhat distorted. All of these characteristics are preserved best as you near the intersection between the equator and the prime meriidian.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h2>WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator</h2>
    <h3>The Pseudo-Mercator projection entirely preserves shape, but distorts size as you move farther from the equator. In result, a country like Greenland, for example, appears much larger than it actually is.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Sphere_Winkel_I</h2>
    <h3>Similar to the Aitoff projection, the Sphere_Winkel_I distorts shape, area, distance, and direction, but achieves a favorable between all of these factors.</h3>
    <a href=".//Worldprojections/maps/53018 Projection.png">
    <img src=".//Worldprojections/maps/53018 Projection.png" alt="Sphere_Winkel_I" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>World_Cylindrical_Equal_Area</h2>
    <h3>This projection severely distorts shape when you near each of the poles, but succeeds in preserving the area of countries and continents.</h3>
    <a href=".//Worldprojections/maps/54034 Projection.png">
    <img src=".//Worldprojections/maps/54034 Projection.png" alt="World_Cylindrical_Equal_Area" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>World_Equidistant_Conic</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves distance, but increasingly distorts area and shape as you move away from the North Pole.</h3>
    <a href=".//Worldprojections/maps/54027 Projection.png">
    <img src=".//Worldprojections/maps/54027 Projection.png" alt="World_Equidistant_Conic" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>North_Pole_Azimuthal_Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves distance and direction while distorting area and shape.</h3>
    <a href=".//Worldprojections/maps/102016 Projection.png">
    <img src=".//Worldprojections/maps/102016 Projection.png" alt="North_Pole_Azimuthal_Equidistant" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>World_Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>In this projection, the equator is preserved, yet shape, area, distance and direction are all distorted.</h3>

    <h2>World_Patterson</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves direction, but distorts size, shape and distance of geographic regions near the poles, exaggerating high latitude areas.</h3>
    <a href=".//Worldprojections/maps/54079 Projection.png">
    <img src=".//Worldprojections/maps/54079 Projection.png" alt="World_Patterson" width='500px'>
